# Clean-and-Analyze-Employee-Exit-Surveys

We'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education,
Training and Employment (DETE), and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE)
institute in Queensland, Australia.

The data are available here from the government of Australia.

The questions stakeholders want answers to are:

Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning
due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
